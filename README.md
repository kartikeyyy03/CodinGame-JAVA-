# CodinGame-JAVA-
CodinGame is a platform that provides coding challenges and puzzles for programmers to solve using various programming languages. This repo contains my personal solutions to the CodeinGame challenges. Feel free to refer to the solutions.
I have used JAVA as my main language for most of the solutions. The syntax for almost all the languages will be almost alike, so you can refer to the solutions for languages other than JAVA.
